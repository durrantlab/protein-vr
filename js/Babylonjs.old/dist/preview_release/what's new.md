# 2.5.0:

### Major updates
- New `StandardRenderingPipeline` effect to support screen space lens flare and depth of field. []Demo](http://www.babylonjs.com/Demos/StandardRenderingPipeline/) - ([Julien Moreau-Mathis](https://github.com/julien-moreau))
- New `HighlightLayer` object to enable highlights rendering. [Demo](http://www.babylonjs.com/Demos/Highlights/) - ([sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan))
- Babylon.js now supports right handed system with ```scene.useRightHandedSystem = true``` ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Babylon.js is now compiled with [optimize-js](https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js) to get faster initial load ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Canvas2D moved to a separate folder in main repo. Now you need to also include babylon.cavans2d.js to get Canvas@D feature ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))

### Updates
- New ```Tools.CreateScreenshot``` function will capture all canvas data. Previous implementation is now called `CreateScreenshotUsingRenderTarget` ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)) 
- Cube textures are now cached by texture cache ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)) 
- Added onAnimationEnd callback for `sprite.playAnimation` ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)) 
- Added support for non square textures for sprites ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)) 
- Added support for texture arrays ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)) 
- Added `camera.isInFrustum` and `camera.isCompletelyInFrustum`. Can be used with meshes, submeshes and boundingInfo ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)) 
- Several memory allocation reduction ([benaadams](https://github.com/benaadams))
- Several GPU state change reduction ([benaadams](https://github.com/benaadams)) 
- MapTexture: add `supersample` mode to double font quality. ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
- New SPS feature : solid particle intersection with other solid particle or with any mesh `particle.intersectsMesh()` ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- New `invertUV` parameter an all ribbon based shapes : ribbon, tube, lathe, basic and custom extrusion ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- Text2D: new `fontSuperSample` setting to use high quality font ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
- PerfCounter class added to monitor time/counter and expose min/max/average/lastSecondAverage/current metrics. Updated engine/scene current counter to use this class, exposing new properties as well to access the PerfCounter object ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
- Better keyboard event handling which is now done at canvas level and not at window level ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)) 
- New `scene.hoverCursor` property to define a custom cursor when moving mouse over meshes ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)) 
- Canvas2D: ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa)) 
 - Performance metrics added
 - Text2D super sampling to enhance quality in World Space Canvas
 - World Space Canvas is now rendering in an adaptive way for its resolution to fit the on screen projected one to achieve a good rendering quality
 - Transparent Primitives are now drawn with Instanced Array when supported
 - New property in Canvas2D (instances) that contains all instances of canvas2d [Temechon](https://github.com/Temechon)
- WebVR Camera was updated to be conform with the current specs. ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW)) 
- New "CubeTextureTask" function will allow you to load a CubeTexture in the assetsManager. ([agallouin](https://github.com/AGallouin)) 
- Scene.stopAnimation has now an optional second parameter, the name of the animation to kill.
Usefull if a mesh has multiple animations. ([agallouin](https://github.com/AGallouin))

### Bug fixes
- Fixed issue with FreeCamera not working in fullscreen or when pointer locked ([abow](https://github.com/abow))
- MapTexture: Font Characters are now correctly aligned on Chrome ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
- Fixed some missing parameter default values in `MeshBuilder.CreateGroundFromHeightMap()` and `MeshBuilder.CreateTiledGround()` ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- Fixed cross vector calculation in `_computeHeightQuads()` that affected  all the `GroundMesh.getHeightAtCoordinates()` and `GroundMesh.getNormalAtCoordinates()` methods ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- Fixed `Mesh.CreateDashedLines()` missing `instance` parameter on update ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- Added BBox update on each ribbon based shape (ribbon, tube, extrusion, etc) on dynamic updates ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- Fixed model shape initial red vertex color set to zero not formerly being taken in account in the `SolidParticleSystem` ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- Fixed billboard when the SPS mesh is parented in the `SolidParticleSystem` ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
- Fixed RenderTargetTexture meshes selection ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Fixed camera speed computation ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Fixed bug with instances, LOD and edgesRendering ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Canvas2D: ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
 - `WorldSpaceCanvas2D`:
	- Intersection/interaction now works on non squared canvas
 - Primitive:
	- `ZOrder` fixed in Primitives created inline
	- Z-Order is now correctly distributed along the whole canvas object graph
 - `Sprite2D`: 
	- texture size is now set by default as expected
	- can have no `id` set
 - `Text2D`: 
	- Fix bad rendering quality on Chrome
	- Rendering above transparent surface is now blending correctly

### Breaking changes
 - Removed legacy shaders support ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
 - Canvas2D: ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
  - `WorldSpaceCanvas2D`:
	- WorldSpaceRenderScale is no longer supported (deprecated because of adaptive feature added).
