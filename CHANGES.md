CHANGES
=======

1.0.2
-----

* Removed support for the WebGL Multiview extension in VR mode. This
  optimization has the potential to speed render times, but it appears to be
  broken on the latest version of FireFox (Windows). Future versions of
  ProteinVR may revisit the Multiview extension.
* Fixed a bug that caused an error when rendering large molecular surfaces.

1.0.1
-----

* Hydrogens are now displayed on PDB files, just like SDF files.
* Improved license visibility in source and compiled code.

1.0.0
-----

The original published version.
